# Introduction
The codes for work "CDF2S: Improving stroke prediction with cluster- based undersampling and interpretable deep forest model".The CDF2S network architecture diagram is as follows:

The model contains 2 components: 
+ (A) CBUC algorithm for ressampling dataset;
+ (B) Deep forest for stroke prediction
# Dataset
The dataset is from kaggle and the link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/cerebral-strokeprediction-imbalance-dataset. It contains 43,400 samples totally, including 10 risk
factors related to stroke and the target variable ‘stroke’.

# Get started
Just run main.py, all the codes are provided there.
